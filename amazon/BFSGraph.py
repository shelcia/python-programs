# Breadth First Search or BFS for a Graph

# Breadth First Traversal (or Search) for a graph is similar to Breadth First Traversal of a tree
# (See method 2 of this post). The only catch here is, unlike trees, graphs may contain cycles,
# so we may come to the same node again. To avoid processing a node more than once,
# we use a boolean visited array. For simplicity, it is assumed that all vertices are reachable
# from the starting vertex.

# For example, in the following graph, we start traversal from vertex 2.
# When we come to vertex 0, we look for all adjacent vertices of it. 2 is also an
# adjacent vertex of 0. If we donâ€™t mark visited vertices, then 2 will be processed again
# and it will become a non-terminating process. A Breadth First Traversal of the following graph
# is 2, 0, 3, 1.

# traverses vertices reachable from s.
