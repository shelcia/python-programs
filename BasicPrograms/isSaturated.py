# You are provided with a number â€™nâ€™. Your task is to tell whether that number is saturated. A saturated number is a number which is made by exactly two digits.

        break
for index in range(1, len(array)):
    if(array[index] != firstNumber and array[index] != secondNumber):
        # print(firstNumber,array[index],secondNumber)
        flag = flag+1
        break
