# You are given an array A of N integers. Your task is to find the maximum number of times an odd number is continuously repeated in the array.

# Input Format

# First line contains N which is the number of element present in the array.

# Second line contains N integers which are the values of array.

# Constraints

# N<100

# Output Format

# Output one integer which the maximum number of times an odd number is repeated in array.

# Sample Input 0

# 12
# 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 1
# Sample Output 0

# 4
# Explanation 0

# 1 is repeated 4 times from index 0 to index 3 => 4 times

# 2 is repeated 5 times from index 4 to index 8 => 5 times

# 1 is repeated 3 times from index 9 to index 11 => 3 times

# So, the output is 4 since 1 is odd.
