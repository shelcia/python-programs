# A left rotation operation on an array shifts each of the array's elements  unit to the left. For example, if  left rotations are performed on array , then the array would become . Note that the lowest index item moves to the highest index in a rotation. This is called a circular array.

# Given an array  of  integers and a number, , perform  left rotations on the array. Return the updated array to be printed as a single line of space-separated integers.

# Function Description

# Complete the function rotLeft in the editor below.

# rotLeft has the following parameter(s):

# int a[n]: the array to rotate
# int d: the number of rotations
# Returns

# int a'[n]: the rotated array
# Input Format

# The first line contains two space-separated integers  and , the size of  and the number of left rotations.
# The second line contains  space-separated integers, each an .

# Constraints

# Sample Input

# 5 4
# 1 2 3 4 5
# Sample Output

# 5 1 2 3 4
# Explanation

# When we perform  left rotations, the array undergoes the following sequence of changes:


def rotate(arr):

    temp = arr[0]

    for idx in range(0, len(arr)-1):
        arr[idx] = arr[idx+1]

    arr[len(arr)-1] = temp

    print(arr)
    return arr


def rotLeft(a, d):

    arr = []
    arr = list(map(int, input().split(' ')[:a]))

    tempArr = arr

    for idx in range(0, d):
        tempArr = rotate(tempArr)

    print('Final Array', tempArr)


if __name__ == "__main__":

    rotLeft(5, 4)
